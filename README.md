Object Detection Project

Welcome to the Object Detection Project repository! This project utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model to detect and classify objects on GB roads, focusing on real-time performance and accuracy.


Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust object detection system tailored to GB roads. Using the YOLO model, this project identifies and classifies objects in images, enhancing road safety and paving the way for potential applications in autonomous driving.


Features

Real-time object detection with YOLO
High accuracy and fast processing speed
Customizable for different environments and datasets
Installation
To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:


bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Wasim-Aly/Object-Detection-Project.git
cd Object-Detection-Project
pip install -r requirements.txt


Usage

Data Preparation: Ensure that your dataset is formatted correctly. You can modify the paths in the code to point to your data.
Training: Run the training script to train the YOLO model on your dataset.
Inference: Use the inference script to detect objects in test images.
Example
Example usage:

python
Copy code
# Run inference on an image
python detect.py --source your_image.jpg --weights yolov5s.pt --conf 0.4
Dependencies
Python
PyTorch
OpenCV
YOLO library
Results
The model achieves high accuracy in detecting multiple objects on GB roads. Example images and performance metrics are available in the results folder.
